# Stealth Auto Refresh Pro 🚀

Stealth Auto Refresh Pro is a Chrome extension that automatically refreshes web pages using **human-like behavior simulation**.  
Instead of simple random reloads, it mimics real user activity such as natural timing, mouse movement, and scrolling.

This makes refresh activity appear realistic and natural.
